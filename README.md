Hello *v0.9*
===

Hello is an open-source WordPress theme I developed for my personal blog, portfolio and resume site. It's built on top of `underscores`. Feel free to use it for your own site.

### Some assembly required.

Some pieces of the theme, like the homepage, are hardcoded and you might need to go edit some theme files to make it yours. I'm working on making the theme more editable through the customizer for future use.


Go nuts. ðŸ––
